## Do certain genres more popular in certain regions, or are genre sales consistent globally?
According to the data visualization within this directory, genre sales are relatviely consistent in North America, Europe, and the rest of the world with Global sales.

However, XBox game sales are relatively low in Japan, so a targeted advertising approach may not be cost effective.
